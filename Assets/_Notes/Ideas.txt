-- Random Ideas

modular hurtbox prefab variant? allows for activating / deactivating colliders for invincibility instead of layer switching, same for enemy and player
allows for more flexibility and fixes the hugging bug after player is invincible but is still touched by the enemy. Also gets rid of nasty layers

the hazard object has a hitbox that doesn't move --done

have spear and sword weapons that implement the modular weapons and hitboxes with pickups

make the slime enemy use its body as a hitbox --done

dismantle the "entity" parent --done
